Open-Questions:
---------------
1. Expected behavior if the product items are not found in the product database?  Does the whole txn fail?

2. What happens if the calculated discount is greater than the price * quantity of a given item?

3. What should the default response be if the cart is empty?

4. What happens when the product is found but the price is 0.0?

5. What happens when the product is found but the price is negative?

6. What should the default response be if the cart is empty?

 
   


TODO:
- implement filter operations to enable paginated data retrieval and filtering
- use mockaroo.com to build a default database with 1000 products, that we import
  on startup to give us some better data for tesitng filtering paths
- Junit coverage ( let's try Gen-AI to see what it can do) 
- need some hardening/robustness around corruption / failure scenarios / parse errors
- try refactoring swagger spec to cleanup the data model
- move classes outside of the generated swagger packages to make it easier for class regeneration
