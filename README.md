# Project Name

This is a take-home-test repository with a simple REST API definition for a fictious PoS retail system named Acme.  The assignment was open on use of technology stack and implementation framework.

## Approach Taken

1. Initially Developed Swagger Api Spec
2. Generated Server-Side Skeleton with swagger-codegen to do most of the heavy lifting
3. Layered in a few Repository + Service Classes
4. Did some refactoring + Leveraged Github Co-Pilot where useful

## Requirements

- Java 17
- MVN 3.9.9

## Usage

1. mvn clean install
2. cd target
3. java -jar swagger-spring-1.0.0.jar
